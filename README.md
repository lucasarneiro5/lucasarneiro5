### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas! I'm 27 and I'm a mechatronics engineer and I'm studying software engineering and data science since my graduation.

I love tech, engineering, musik and soccer!!

I'm looking forward to applying Artificial Intelligence in different areas like mechanic systems (Self-Driving cars), sports, and digital marketing.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning basics algorithms and always practicing SoldWorks and PCB design. I'm gonna improve my skills in that and keep forward to learning Computer Vision!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and Data Structures besides mechanics and electronics design.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on GitHub and Medium and any project involving mechanic systems (Self-Driving cars), sports or digital marketing
